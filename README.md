## Overview

Welcome to the **VM-to-Hack Translator**—  
a comprehensive tool developed in Python for converting programs  
written in the VM (Virtual Machine) language into the Hack assembly language.  
This translator is a key component in the process of building a virtual machine and understanding low-level computing concepts.


The VM-to-Hack Translator bridges high-level VM commands and low-level assembly,
demonstrating how compilers translate abstract instructions into operations that a CPU can execute,
thus offering insight into the fundamentals of computer architecture.
